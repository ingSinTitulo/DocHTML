# The `<!--...-->` (comment) tag
The comment tag is used to document the html code. It is ignored by the renderer and can be used to write explanations or notes.
The posible workarounds for old browsers like the Internet Explorer conditionals or the JavaScript trick to hide it from being printed in screen as plain text in browsers that do not support this scripting language **will never be used**. We do not support non HTML 5 complaint browsers.

## Attributes
The comment tag does not support any attribute.

## Example
```html
<!-- This is my comment, i can safely write anything and it will not be displayed because the renderer will skip this content -->
```
