# The `<div>` element
Defines a block section in the document

- Useful to divide the contents of the document without creating specific elements, because it only divides the document in blocks but does not change the way elements inside it are rendered

## Attributes
| Name | Posible values | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| [Global attributes](../first-steps/global-attributes.md) | N/A | `<div>` supports all global attributes. |

## Example
```html
<!-- These are three blocks, each one can use different styles -->
<div>
    Dogs are hairy mammals
</div>
<div>
    I really like golden retrievers
</div>
<div>
    None of the dogs i already have are golden retrievers but i still love them
</div>
