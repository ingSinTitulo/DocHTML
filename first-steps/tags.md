# What is an HTML tag?
This: `<tag>`, but more exactly:

HTML is based on XML. So the tag is just a word wrapped in a pair grater-than and less-than symbols i.e. `<tag>`. And yes, there are actually some elements in HTML that look like that (`<br>`, `<tr>`, for example).
For future references, the structure of an HTML tag is
1. a less-than symbol (`<`)
2. the type of the tag
3. a list of one or more [attributes](attributes.md) or not, this means this part is optional
4. a greater-than symbol (`>`)
