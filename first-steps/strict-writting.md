# Strict writting

## Basic rules
This is simple, if this documentation tells you to write `ABCD` you should probably not write `ADCD`. It is very simple to see they are not the same. Now, sometimes you will find something like `Hello, [mammal]! ... Bye!`, so you may replace the `[mammal]` part by the name of any animal species which females feed their babies with their own breast milk, and the three dots by anything. So `Hello, cat! My dog eats grass. Bye!` is compliant with the `Hello, [mammal]! ... Bye!` notation. I replaced `[mammal]` by `cat` and the three dots by `My dog eats grass.` and we can all agree that this is true.

## Please, use logic
I will really thank you if you are proactive and by simple logic exercises you find the way of writting a valid HTML document. It is not that hard, just think a little. HTML is the easiest language we will learn so treat it as the easy thing it is and do not be scared.
